# Getting Started with Mera Monitor API

This guide will help you get started with the Mera Monitor API by showing you how to generate and use your API credentials.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
1. A Mera Monitor account with administrative access
2. Access to your organization's settings

## Generating API Credentials

### Step 1: Access API Settings
1. Log in to your Mera Monitor dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings > API Integration
3. Click on "Generate New API Credentials"

### Step 2: Configure API Access
1. Enter a name for your API integration (e.g., "Production Integration")
2. Select the required permissions for your integration
3. Click "Generate Credentials"

### Step 3: Save Your Credentials
After generation, you'll receive:
- Client ID
- Client Secret

**Important**: Store these credentials securely. The client secret will only be shown once.

## Best Practices

1. **Security**
   - Never share your client secret
   - Store credentials securely
   - Rotate credentials periodically
   - Use environment variables for credentials

2. **Token Management**
   - Access tokens expire after 30 days
   - Implement token refresh logic
   - Handle token expiration gracefully

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Monitor your API usage
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use appropriate retry mechanisms

## Next Steps

Now that you have your API credentials, you can:
1. Review the [API Documentation](/docs/api-documentation) for available endpoints
2. Start making API calls to integrate with Mera Monitor
3. Set up webhooks for real-time updates
