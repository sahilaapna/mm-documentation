# Attendance Management

Mera Monitor provides a detailed Attendance Management module to track employee presence, leaves, and logged hours. The interface offers different views tailored to the roles within your organization.

## Navigating Attendance Views

Located at the top of the Attendance section, you can switch between different perspectives:

*   **Organization View:** (Available to Admins) Provides a comprehensive overview of attendance across the entire company.
*   **Team View:** (Available to Admins and Managers) Shows attendance data specifically for the teams managed by the user.
*   **Individual View:** Shows detailed attendance for a single user. Accessible by Admins/Managers selecting a user, or by individual members viewing their own data.

## Organization / Team View (Admin/Manager)

This view gives managers and administrators a consolidated look at their team's or the entire organization's attendance summary over a selected period.
