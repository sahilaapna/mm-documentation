# Invitation Management

After adding members (individually or via bulk upload), you can manage their invitations:

*   **Automated Emails:** Invitation emails with activation links are sent automatically upon member addition.
*   **Track Status:** Monitor the status of invitations (e.g., Sent, Pending Activation, Accepted).
*   **Manage Invitations:** Resend invitations to members who haven't accepted or revoke invitations if needed (e.g., if an email was entered incorrectly).
