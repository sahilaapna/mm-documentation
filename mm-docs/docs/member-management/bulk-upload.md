# Bulk User Upload

For adding multiple members efficiently:

1.  Download the provided bulk upload template (usually a CSV file).
2.  Fill in the user details in the template. Email addresses are typically required, while other fields like Name, Manager, Department might be optional.
3.  Upload the completed template file through the Member Management interface.
4.  The system processes the file, sends invitations to the new members, and provides a summary, highlighting any errors encountered during the upload (e.g., duplicate emails, missing required information).
