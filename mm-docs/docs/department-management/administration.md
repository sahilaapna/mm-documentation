# Department Administration

Administrators can manage departments through the Department Management interface:

*   **Edit Departments:** Modify the name or other properties of existing departments.
*   **Delete Departments:** Remove departments that are no longer needed (ensure members are reassigned if necessary).
*   **Reassign Members:** Move members between departments as organizational structures change.
*   **Filtering/Searching:** Use available filters or search functions to quickly find specific departments, especially in large organizations.
