# User Default Settings

These settings allow administrators to configure default monitoring and privacy options for individual users or groups.

## Monitoring Features

Control specific monitoring aspects:

*   **Capture Screenshot:** Enable or disable screenshot capture for users.
*   **View Screenshot:** Determine who has permission to view captured screenshots (e.g., admins, managers).
*   **Live Monitoring:** Enable or disable live screen streaming and recording capabilities.
*   **Monitoring Toggle:** A master switch to enable or disable all monitoring features for the user.

## Privacy and Security

Configure user-facing privacy options:

*   **Stealth Mode:** If enabled, hides the monitoring agent icon and notifications from the user's system.
*   **Private Mode:** Allows users to temporarily pause monitoring for privacy (e.g., during breaks).
*   **Notification:** Controls whether users receive notifications about their monitoring status.

## Time Management

*   **Stop Timer Enable:** Allows users to manually pause the activity timer.

Setting interfaces often use visual indicators like toggles (e.g., purple for enabled, grey for disabled) to show the status of each option.
